# GeoFHIR

GeoFHIR is a framework for analyzing geographic patterns in healthcare data using FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standards. The platform allows healthcare providers to upload FHIR data and map it against geographic infrastructure data to identify potential environmental health risks.

## Problem Statement

Healthcare providers often have valuable data showing patterns of disease but lack the tools to correlate these patterns with environmental factors. GeoFHIR bridges this gap by providing a platform where hospitals can:

- Upload FHIR-formatted patient data
- Map patient locations and diagnoses against geographic data (e.g., water pipelines, industrial facilities)
- Identify potential correlations between health conditions and environmental factors
- Generate visualizations and reports to support public health interventions

## Features

- FHIR data ingestion and processing
- Geographic data integration (pipelines, infrastructure, etc.)
- Interactive mapping visualization
- Correlation analysis between health data and geographic features
- Reporting and export functionality
- Role-based access controls for sensitive health data

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension for geospatial capabilities
- **FHIR Integration**: fhirclient Python library
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js
- **Mapping**: Google Maps API integration
- **Geospatial Data**: GeoJSON format support

## Getting Started

*Detailed setup instructions coming soon*

## Architecture Overview

GeoFHIR uses a layered architecture:

1. **Data Layer**: PostgreSQL database with PostGIS for storing both health records and geographic information
2. **API Layer**: FastAPI endpoints for data ingestion, queries, and analysis
3. **Visualization Layer**: React/Next.js frontend with interactive mapping components
4. **Analytics Layer**: Python-based correlation analysis between health and geographic data
